# Restricted servers list. Matching items in this list will prevent alerting (but not logging).
# This list is pattern matched with the warning string. The server is still tested and logged.
# A match in the list below prevents an alert being sent.
# To be excluded from an alert, the server IP or hostname must match that in the servers list.  
# Partial matches such as 192.168 can be used to disable alerts for a subnet.
# Lines beginning with # or space or a new line are ignored

# Your restricted devices go here:
192.168.0.1
192.168.0.2
